# Introduction to Node
In this document I attempt to introduce the nube to nodejs from almost no knowledge 
to an example framework for developing modular websites.  Having recently started 
learning nodejs myself I was overwealmed with the number of frameworks and modules 
available and the many different ways you can automate your build process and testing.

This is by no means claiming to be THE best way to do things.  I am a nube myself.  
This is just helping others in trails I have crossed myself so far.

I break this tutorial down into sections.  Each section has a separate nodejs module 
you can install to start (except the first one) so you can pick up wherever you like.  
It walks you through step by step with copious explanations and experiments to help you 
understand concepts I had trouble mastering.  My hope is that this model will serve as a 
place to add lessons for all kinds of nodejs modules so the lesson list is heiarchical 
where others can insert what they want to focus on.
